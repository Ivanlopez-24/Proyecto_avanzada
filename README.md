Cinema Application Project Report
1. Introduction
This project focuses on the development of a cinema application that allows users to browse movies, check showtimes, select seats, make reservations, and process payments. The application includes both a front-end user interface and a back-end system managing reservations, payments, and notifications. The project is intended to be simple but functional for a university-level requirement, incorporating essential software engineering concepts and clear user flows.

2. Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to deliver a functioning cinema application that includes:

User registration and login.
Displaying movie listings and details.
Selecting showtimes and seats.
Processing payments and reservations.
Sending notifications and confirmations.
